All LaTeX templates in Research for PSHS-CARC

Although these templates were designed with use within PSHS-CARC in mind, it is suggested that other campuses localize the template for their own ease of use, or use as is. I am well aware that LaTeX does have a learning curve, so this might seem unappealing to others, but I still recommend using the LaTeX, a source control management (SCM) system like git and a bibliographical reference management system for a more content-focused method of paper-writing with no worries of data loss or lack of collaboration.

I have a personal setup, with VSCode and Zotero, however you are free to use whatever setup you are comfortable with.

Thank you.

## Quick Setup
If you prefer not to install the various software applications listed below one-by-one, I recommend proTeXt, a quick and simple TeX distribution for Windows that contains the basic requirements to get you up and running in using the LaTeX template. Do keep in mind however that you have to produce your .bib files either manually or via some other bibliographical reference management system.

[Download the latest version of proTeXt here](https://www.tug.org/protext/)

## Personal Setup
### TeXLive
Contains every package the template could ever have a dependency on.

**DISCLAIMER: Haven't tested the templates yet on other distributions of LaTeX**

### Visual Studio Code
