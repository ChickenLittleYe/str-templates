# str-templates
All LaTeX templates in Research for PSHS-CARC

## My Setup
### Visual Studio Code
#### LaTeX Editing
 - LaTeX Workshop by James Yu (Build on Save as well as code snippets and code linting)
 - LaTeX Utilities by tecosaur (Formatted pastes and Zotero citation management)
 - LTeX (Grammar Check) **Note: You need to install extensions for languages you require**
#### Source Control Management
Use git and github for SCM (VS Code has natural support)
 - Git Graph (Visualize commits and changes)

### Zotero
Reference Management Platform with Collaborative Features
 - Extensions for Browsers (e.g. Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox)
 - Better Bibtex (Synchronize .bib file with Zotero Data)

## Traditional Paper
