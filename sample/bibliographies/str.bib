  abstract = {"Wind energy is pivotal in global electricity generation and for contributing for achieving future essential energy demands and targets. In this fast moving field, Wind Energy Engineering: A Handbook for onshore and offshore Wind Turbines is the most advanced, up to date, and research focused text on all aspects of wind energy engineering. This must-have edition starts with an in-depth look at the fundamentals of wind power, the present state of wind power in the worldwide, integration into national grids, and continues with a high-level assessment of the advances in turbine technology and how the investment, planning, aesthetics, and economic infrastructure can support those innovations. It also includes chapters on storing wind energy, small-scale wind systems, life cycle assessments, investments, and growth trends" -- Back cover},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}em{$>$}The Golden Mean, an irrational number related to the Fibonacci sequence, arises in the study of biological growth and hierarchical systems. Quite distinct from natural structures that exhibit such growth patterns, artists and architects have long made extraordinary assertions about a preference for rectangles having aspect ratio 1.618:1 approximating the Golden Mean. Such claims are false and are chiefly due to failing to measure things accurately. These embarrassing errors are perpetuated by a kind of cult mysticism. The Golden Mean does apply to architectural composition in the context of scaling hierarchy that organizes complexity; this design methodology is unrelated however to a rectangleâ€™s aspect ratio. Simply considering rectangular aspect ratios does not guarantee good design.{$<$}/em{$><$}/p{$>$}}
